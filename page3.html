            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>"Now, tell what you know", asked Aradhya. They all were assembled in the lab room sitting around a table which was set in the front part of the room near the windows. Professor Sawhney's arrest was a shock for all of them. No one had ever expected that for a person like him, so genial was he and always stayed absorbed in his own bussines.</p><p>"I can't exactly tell but from about a month he became essentric. He was not his own self. Never answered my calls and hesitated whenever I asked about his prolonged visits to the town", droned Shiv in a manner of brooding over a thought. "We all have noticed that Shiv, but what on earth it has to do with his arrest", said James. "The officials gave us no exact answers, I think we should check in his work room. Who knows what we get", said Agastya. "I think it's a good idea", said Aradhya.</p><p>"Uhm, why the hell it's not opening", complained Agastya. "It's jammed stupid", said Aradhya. "No, it's not jammed, it's locked", said Shiv, "I know the handle is moving, but it's not locked that way, maybe it has some kind of biometric lock". "So we'll never be able to open it", said Aradhya.</p><p>"Hey! Are you out of your mind", exclaimed Aradhya. James was holding an axe in his hand. He stabbed the door with it and an ear piercing alarm broke out. "What's all this security is for, jewelleries or gold or he's got the kohinoor diamond locked in there", asked Agastya jokingly.</p><p>They all stepped inside. There was nothing amiss. "OK let's check his laptop", Agastya said and started to fiddle with it. "I don't understand what Professor wanted to say. What was that 'truth' thing", wondered Aradhya.&nbsp;</p><p>"Here's nothing guys, it's absolutely blank, not even the documents of his research", said Agastya. "Which is really wierd, maybe those officials erased his documents when they came here to arrest him. Obiously they took him out from this room" James observed.</p><p>"I think that for now we should go back to the hall and continue our work, I hope we will be informed soon", said Shiv.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They all worked till the afternoon when they took a break to lunch. Even working on the image of the rare supernova did not cheer Shiv up. She felt like she was forgetting something, something very important. Then suddenly Agastya shouted,"Guys, I've &nbsp;got a mail from the </span><strong>ISRO</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">. They say that a new head of the observatory is arriving two days later i.e. on Monday". James stood up and came to Shiv. He said,"Isn't it strange, they are doing it all too quickly". Now Aradhya also joined the conservation," Ya, last time when Professor Parth retired, it was nearly a month before Professor Sawhney joined in."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Eventually it was night, 10:00 to be exact. They closed all the work, shut down the observatory and headed back to their quarters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Their 'home', as they call it, was really huge. It had six rooms (each with a bathroom), a big hall for dining and other purposes, a kitchen, a basement and a garden along with a backyard (Luxurious).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They all sat dining around the table, which was in the hall along the wall beside the kitchen, the delicious food of Mrs. Mufti released some stress, when the conversation broke out. "We should check his room", proposed Aradhya. "What we will get there, foul socks", joked Agastya. "It's worth a try, what if we get some clues ourselves before the authorities explain us the situation", Shiv said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After dinner Shiv and James went in Professor Sawhney's room. Aradhya remained in the hall, processing the images of the star's explosion. Whereas Agastya went to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As expected the room was in its place, nonetheless they searched through all the papers, books and his cupboards. When Shiv was rummaging Professor's clothes, she found his pen case. It was no ordinary pen case, it was one of the finest works of the Parker's. It &nbsp;was gifted to him by the prime minister when he made his discovery on black holes. Instinctively Shiv opened the case, but what is this, it was empty. Shiv called James," Look James it's empty". "What! What's empty. Oh this case, strange, it was his most important thing and now he is so careless with it". Shiv opened her mouth to say but before she could say anything James again said,"No, he didn't carry the pen with him. I was there when the officials took him out of the room."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They came down and called out for everyone to assemble. Aradhya came with a start and Agastya with a bump on his head. "Ouch, who's now arrested again. I can't become an owl for this bussines." "Shut up Agastya", chided Aradhya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"We have got this empty pen case of the Professor", said James showing the pen case."Wow! I'm going to sleep." said Agastya. "Leave him Aradhya, he's right this is not enough, the mystery still remains".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">They all went to sleep. That day was a real mystery and more questions await them.<br></span><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
