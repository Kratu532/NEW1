            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>The day started as usual. That day they had lots of work to do. The report over supernova was posted early morning and now the observation work was to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>Whole day Mr. Hans stayed in his room. He not even came out for lunch. </p><p>Shiv felt very lost that day. After the humdrum of these three days now she was feeling really worried for Professor Sawhney. It's been a lot of time and still they didn't know why he was arrested. His supervision on these scientific projects really smoothed things out, she thought. &nbsp; &nbsp; She slowly drifted away in her thoughts.</p><p><em>"How worried I was on my first day here. But Professor Sawhney very easily relaxed me. Soon I started feeling like home</em>&nbsp;here. <em>And the other day when our team first found a rare type of galaxy, how happy he was. I remember those eyes, like two stars in a wrinkled nest. Last year when we all were sitting in the backyard and Agastya was telling one of his made up stories, he had said to me, "You don't know Shiv what the facts are". &nbsp;</em><em>"But professor how can you be so sure". "Because I know there is definitely something in these rumours. If there is smoke then there should be a fire". "But you can't believe in this. Those shepherds, they make these stories for amusement". "No Shiv. I have met them personally and I have seen their truth in their eyes". &nbsp; "So what they say". "Well one of them said that they hear some rumbling noises in that <strong>cave mountain</strong>. The frequency of these happenings are more at the foot of &nbsp;that cave mountain.&nbsp;</em><em>Don't look at me like that, I'm not saying anything supernatural does that, but there should be some scientific explanation for that. Mountains don't ring on themselves. I've got to find this out". &nbsp;"You'll see professor its just a pastime story..............</em></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Hey where are you lost", Aradhya shook her. "Err, nothing", said Shiv. But now she was thinking that whether this incident has something to do to the mystery that hangs over them. Is there any thruth in what those shepherds say? Shiv made up her mind that she will look into the matter further. &nbsp;What if she gets some clue as to whether professor really researched this matter or finally changed his mind not to bother into these village people's stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">That night they had an overnight observation so Shiv and Agastya were still in the observatory while others were sleeping. For once Shiv thought that she should tell Agastya about what she was upto but then decided against it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I don't like this Hans. He is such a "hate me" kind of person", said Agastya making a disgusted face. "Ya right. Do you really think he was searching rabbits in those bushes", laughed Shiv. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you really think I'm mad", smiled Agastya. "Of course, I think", she laughed, "but seriously it was wierd". "Yes ", said Agastya and got lost in thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was about 11:00. Agastya had dozed off, his head sunk on his chest. Shiv stood up and went to the lab room, which is at the right to the hall. Earlier in the evening she had put coffee in a thermoflask on the gathering table in that room. She filled up her cup and turned towards the door.</span></p><p>Her legs stopped a few steps away from the entrance. She hid behind the door and peeped out.</p><p>Mr. Hans was standing beside Agastya and was looking sideways. Apparantly he was checking whether someone else was also there. When he was satisfied that no one except snoring Agastya was present there, then he silently tiptoed towards his office door. He locked the door behind him, atleast this is what Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>"This man's never going to come out. It's over an hour", she thought. Untill now she had emptied two cups of coffee. Then after about five minutes she heard the creaking of the door hinges. She swiftly took her position behind the door and fixed her eyes at the entrance. Hans slowly came out of the office and locked the door with his key. Then he silently went out of the observatory.</p><p>Shiv came back to the hall and half fell on a chair. She was trying to make sense with what she had just witnessed. "I'll tell Aradhya about this", she mumbled under her breath. She glanced at the clock, which hung at the front wall, it was midnight. She took in a deep breath and started working on the data collected by the telescope all this while.</p><p><br></p></div>
