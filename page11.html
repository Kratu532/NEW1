            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>She woke up early this morning and was walking to and fro in her room humming frantically over some of her research papers. Suddenly she bumped her leg in the sidetable beside her bed. "Ouch, aah", she started jumping on one leg holding the other in her hand. Only then she noticed that a box had fallen on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>"Aah, I had completely forgotten about it," and she sat down on her bed, still rubbing her leg. She tried with all her might to open that box but it's lid won't budge. "I think i'll have to cut it, but it'll be a pity to cut such a pretty box," so she put that box on the table and hid her face behind her papers.</p><p>"Shiv, will you go to town today", shouted Mrs. Mufti from behind the door. She sat erect in her bed. "What?", she asked astonished. Mrs. Mufti entered her room. She was holding the laundry basket in her hands. "Our goods supplier is out of town and I needed monthly rations and no one's free to go. They all refused to leave the observatory, so will you go", said Mrs. Mufti in one breath. "OK", replied Shiv.</p><p>"Now, I won't have to lie to anyone", she murmured happily.</p><p>It was noon and Shiv had hurridly summed up her day's work, others were very confused that why she was so excited to bring rations. </p><p>She was in her room and was packing up some trifles like a magnifying glass, a torch, a notebook and a pen, some snacks (mystery solving is very tedious), and her smart phone (very important). "Sherlock Holmes always helps, am I forgetting something, No", she said to herself.</p><p>"Yes grandma where's the list", she said. "What is this backpack for", said Mrs. Mufti staring at her bag. "Nothing, gimme the list, hurry". She put the list and money in her bag and rushed out.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I'll have to search that cave swiftly, I don't have much time". She was walking through the woods so that no one could see her going towards that cave. In less than fifteen minutes she reached the cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">There was no one around the cave, at least that is what she saw. So she hurridly put her things down, and took out her torch as it was dark inside the cave and started examining the cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The stalactites were a magnificient piece of limestone work. The nature had spent years on nurturing them which can be seen in the intricate patterns carved on them. But they were like any other stalactites and had nothing peculiar about them. So she drifted her attention towards the walls where she hoped to find any electronic device which could explain the strange noises heard at that place. She was pretty sure that someone must be joking with the poor villagers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It took more time to examine them than she had previously thought. She was looking at the moss on the cave walls with her torch when she noticed that in that moss covered wall there was a clean rectangular patch on the stone covered with dust, not much in size but it was perfectly rectangular. She wiped away the dust and saw that some strange symbols were carved on the surface of the rock. She briskly went to her bag, took out her notebook and pen and drew those symbols. "These symbols must be of some ancient language or I don't know but they surely mean something", she mumbled under her breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Clank", there was a sudden, sharp noise of falling down as of metal on the floor. Shiv stood rooted at her spot, looking blankly in the dark, her heart was thumping so loudly that she could hear her heartbeat. Definitely she was alone, but then this noise. She took up her torch, holding it firmly in her hand she slowly moved towards the place from where she thought the noise came. When she reached there she saw nothing which could have caused that clanking noise. There only was a wall in front of her. She started examining it, by now she was completely drenched in sweat, though the temperature was pretty low.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In this wall too she saw a perfect rectangular spot in the centre and when she cleared away the dust she saw those strange symbols engraved on it. She noted down these too in her notebook. After sometime she was completely convinced that no other clue could be found there so it was time to return. She started packing her bag, checking that nothing was left behind except footmarks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She was feeling very hot (even in this cold hilly atmosphere) and was very tired so she sat down, took out her water bottle and gulped down the cold water. She was looking out of the cave towards the mountains, visible above the pine forest. She sat marvelling over them when she thought she heard something, some strange voice, no not a single voice it's voices, some people are talking but she can't make out the words. What is this language? It sounded like a whisper of some people not far away. But she was....... alone here.......&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Next time I'll bring my friends and some weapons too, this is a very wierd bussiness", she panted as she hastily returned to the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After taking all the supplies from the town she headed towards the observatory, as the distance was not much so they usually walked the length. In the way back, she thought, "It was so stupid of me to run away like this but it is terrifying when you are alone in that creepy cave".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She was back untill the tea-time and everyone was assembled in the hall. Mr. Hans was nowhere to be seen and Mrs. Mufti was busy in the house chores so it was perfect time to reveal the truth of her expeditions, Shiv thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She sat on the sofa holding a sandwitch in her hand. Everyone was grouped around her like children around grandma when she narrates them a bedtime story, Agastya and Aradhya were sitting on the sofa in front of her, James was sitting beside her sipping tea. "You'll think I'm mad or something but whatever I'm going to tell you is completely true". And she told them about whatever happened since she first thought to gather clues about professor's expeditions to the town to when she first met that group of people beside the teashop and about what happened today. "Don't look at me like that I'm not an alien", she said to Agastya showing them the symbols which she found on the cave walls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Hmph, so from next time I'll be with you whenever you'll go there again", said James looking concerned. "Why don't you told us about it before", asked Aradhya. "I wanted to be sure that I'm not working on a folklore and it's really worth our time, and now I have enough proof".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"When are you planning to visit that place again", asked Agastya. "Whenever you all are ready", Shiv replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> "I've been solving a mystery too", said Aradhya, "you remember Shiv, you mentioned once that you saw Hans lurking in the backyard behind the bushes, so I thought to follow him and figure out what he does there and I found that he goes there to smoke". "Hmm so that one's solved but we still don't know why he visits his office at midnights when no one's around", said James looking serious. "I feel like we all are detectives rather than scientists", said Agastya.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What about these symbols, what do they mean?", said Aradhya. "They could be cave paintings", replied Shiv. " They're not cave paintings. They are ancient mythology symbols", said Agastya. "And what that means", asked Aradhya. "Something exciting", replied Agastya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Lets get back to work", said James. "Agastya any news from the officials about professor Sawhney", asked Shiv. "No, nothing", he replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was a full moon night and the moonlight entering from the windows soflty glimmered on the floor. Everything was silent and peaceful. Shiv woke up with a start, it was a very bad dream, she still can see the astoroid hurtling towards Earth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I feel very thirsty. What time is it," she glanced at the bedside clock. It was about three in the morning.</span></p></div>
