            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>"Happy birthday!!!!", came a noise from behind. Startled Shiv turned her chair and what was that, James, Aradhya and Mrs. Mufti were standing there wearing birthday caps and holding balloons. (In that noise, Agastya woke up suddenly and fell out of his chair). Mrs. Mufti looked like a clown, Shiv thought and wondered how she agreed for that plan of her friends.</p><p>At the same time she was both surprised and happy. Actually she had herself forgot about her birthday in solving these ever increasing mysteries.</p><p>"Happy birthday child, may the God grace upon you," blessed Mrs. Mufti. "Ya, gimme my homework back", yawned Agastya and stetched himself. But soon he realised what he said and wished greetings to Shiv. "You've been sleeping", said Aradhya looking scornfully at Agastya. Agastya made an equally scornful face at her.&nbsp;</p><p>"Leave Aradhya, come Shiv I've something for you", said James and he lead everyone to the lab room. There he opened a cake box on the table, lit a candle on it and let out a knife towards the birthday girl. "How old are you now?", asked Agastya. "24, bit old isn't it?", smiled Shiv.&nbsp;</p><p>She blew the candles. Everyone chorused the birthday song, merrily. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aft<span style="font-size: 1rem;">er this little party was over, Mrs. Mufti cleared the table and went back to the quarters.&nbsp;</span></p><p>"Where is Mr. Hans", enquired Shiv. "He is sleeping and I don't want him to ruin our party", said Aradhya with a frown over her face. Shiv thought about what she had witnessed an hour ago and decided to disscuss it later in the day.</p><p>"Now you both go and rest, we will manage here", said Shiv. "Have a cup of coffee and don't doze off again", said Aradhya handing a cup off coffee to Agastya. And they both went away. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv was standing outside the observatory facing the rising sun. It gleamed in her eyes and her hairs flapped against her brown face in the cool, chilly morning breeze. The town in the valley beneath looked so beautiful. The pine trees were adorned with cold pearls and it seemed that the sun rays were carressing the mist that engulfed the valley.&nbsp;</p><p>She felt very sleepy. James was heading straight to her. "Go and have rest", said he smiling and headed towards the observatory.</p><p>Shiv slept till late in the afternoon. She woke up at 2:00, got ready and went downstairs in the hall. "What's in the lunch grandma", she enquired. "Sandwiches, child", replied Mrs. Mufti. By the time the table was ready, Agastya was also downstairs.</p><p>"Any news from the officials about professor Sawhney", asked Shiv. "Nothing", said agastya, "but I have hopes that soon there will be a clarification. By the way there's an order from your parents, maybe a present, it's in my room, take it when you please".</p><p>"Agastya I'm going to the town, will you come", asked Shiv. "No, I have work to do. Why are you going there?", &nbsp;asked Agastya. "Just for a stroll", said Shiv. Actually she had made up her mind to talk to the people of the town about professor Sawhney. She hoped to find the reason behind his frequent visits there.</p><p>She was standing at the entrance of that small town, her face towards north. Behind her was a long winding road that lead to the city of himanchal, the hill station. At the west of the town was the cliff at which the observatory can be seen. From all the other sides, the town was surrounded with hills and mountains. At the north east from the entrance, the cave mountain was visible, about a kilometer away.&nbsp;</p><p>She walked in a small teashop and sat on a table under the shed. The evening hasn't arrived yet but the mountains shadowed the whole town and it was hard to believe that it was still 3:00. She sat in a corner and started looking around. The teashop boy put a cup of steaming hot tea in front of her and went away. She took a sip and it felt the best thing in this cold. </p><p>Suddenly her eyes fell upon a group of villagers who sat grouped around a man whose face was concieled behind a black, tattered&nbsp;<em>shawl</em>. This group was sitting beside the wall of the teashop in front of her, not far away so that she could eavesdrop. </p><p>That man was sitting huddled up and was smoking <em>hookah</em>. Behind the curtain of smoke and black <em>shawl</em>&nbsp;a harsh voice came as if lost in some dream,</p><p><em>"I'll tell you how it happened. It was a dark and foggy december night, snow was falling steadily and the cold wind was shreaking like a dead soul. I was sleeping beside my bonfire in that cave", </em>And he pointed towards that cave mountain, "<em>Suddenly a voice came,a humming voice, then a thud, as if something has fallen. Then noise of some footsteps in hurry and suddenly it was all silent. I thought that I was dreaming so I slept on. But I was mistaken because about an hour later I heard those noises again. This time I was sure, so I picked up a log from my fire and headed inside the cave towards the source of the noise. I walked for about fifteen minutes but never met a soul. There was no one and still I was sure that I heard those noises. I came back to my sleeping place but what I see, all my possesions were gone, well there was nothing much, but still someone stole it", </em>finished the man. Eveyone in the group seemed awstruck with such an incredible story.</p><p><em>" Ya you're right",</em> interjected one of the listners and he started reciting his own story, <em>"You know, once I was crossing by that cave mountain. I was tierd by my journey so I decided to sit inside it for some time. As I was munching my snacks I heard some people talking. So I stopped chewing to listen their talk. And you know they were talking in a very strange language. I was not able to make out a single word as their voices were quite low. So I decided that I should go and meet these people and when I reached the place there was no one. I was so terrified that I ran straight away from there," </em>finished that villager with a triumphed smile, looking at the intruiged faces of the others. All the other villagers started murmuring in consent that the cave mountain is really haunted. Some others also mentioned that they hear strange noises in night from that cave mountain.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After some time the crowd dispersed and that man started walking away, he slightly limped as he walked. Shiv instantly slammed the bill money on table and started following him. That man went into the pine trees behind the tea shop. Shiv waited untill they both were well out of sight and then called him from behind to stop. He turned towards her and took off the <em>shawl </em>from his face. That man looked completely like a beggar and was surely a vagabond.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I want to ask you some thing", she said.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"It's that cave mountain right", said he in a droning voice. "Yes and no, did you ever tell this story to anyone from the cliff over yonder", she pointed. "Hmm, once an old person had asked me. He was very desparate about it and even asked me to accompany him to that place. But why are you asking about it?" &nbsp;"Can you take me there?" &nbsp;"Hmm".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">He took her towards the mountain amidst that pine forest. The branches bruished her arm at places, but these attacks were unaffected on the limbs of that man who would have been suffering them for years. Even though he was limped but he faced no difficulty in walking over the uneven paths of the forest. The evening was getting in closer and the mist started spreading itself over the whole town. The forest appeared more ghastly with trees like sentinals standing on gaurd. Birds were croaking rather than chirping.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"It feels like an hour", thought Shiv. But soon the trees started lessen and they came at the edge of the pine forest. The cave was visible at the foot of a rather short mountain (but still it was huge). The mouth of the cave was very large. Large stalactites hanged from the ceiling of the cave. And it's walls were covered with moss. Huge boulders of rocks were littered over the whole cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was getting darker so Shiv decided to return. "I've seen the place so I'll come back here later", She thought. "Ok, so is there any way other than the forest to return to village", she asked. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took her back to the town through a dirt track. On reaching the town she asked him, "Where can I meet you if I ever needed you again". "At the edge of that forest behind the tea shop, I have a small hut of mine", he replied dryly and went away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Shiv returned to the house. "Where were you so late?", asked Agastya, he was sitting near the window working on his computer. "I had wandered off the town, so it took me a while to find the way back", she replied and rushed towards her room (which was on the first floor). "I've put your parcel in your room", shouted Agastya from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was a big parcel box, so Shiv hoped for a good present. There were gifts from her other friends piled at her bed. She smiled smugly. "I'll have to change my clothers, the sleeves are scratched badly. It was mere luck that Agastya was sitting in the dark and Mrs. Mufti was not around otherwise it would have been a hard job explaining", murmured Shiv under her breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She swiftly changed and jumped at her bed to open her presents. Her parents had sent her a beautiful&nbsp;<em>saree</em>&nbsp;to wear with a small birthday card. "Blue as always", she thought. Agastya and Aradhya had gifted her jointly (which was a surprise as they are never at good terms) a book by Agatha Christie. James had gifted her a bracelet with her initials carved on it. "How pretty",she exclaimed and put it on her wrist. Mrs. Mufti had presented her a small flute (this really confused her as she didn't knew how to play one). And obiously nothing from Mr. Hans. She really missed professor Sawhney's present.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She lay reading her new present untill called for dinner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Thank you all for your presents. I was really overwhelmed with joy. By the way, what is the flute for grandma", she asked. "For you to learn to play it", replied Mrs. Mufti laughing. "What you guys been doing all day", asked James and glanced at his present. "Workin' on that data you gave me to analyse, forgot", said Agastya. "I've visited the town", said Shiv and thought, "I'll tell them about my true purpose only when I get some clue or they will think I've lost my mind in believing these folklores".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Somehow I'll have to sneak time tommorow to visit that cave", she thought. And slowly drifted away to sleep. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p></div>
