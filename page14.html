            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>"Now that I'm awake, I should do some work", thought Shiv and came out of her bed. She took out her laptop and started fiddling.&nbsp;</p><p>It's been about twenty minutes and by now she was wide awake, when she thought she heard something. It sounded like someone stepped by her door. She silently went out of her bed and moved towards the door. Quitely she peeped outside. It was Hans. She was sure she could identify his tall, erect figure even in pitch black. Now the hall was shining with moonlight and he was walking to and fro in the hall. "He is searching something", Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly he stopped and moved towards the long hall windows. He stood there looking outside. Shiv came out of her room and slowly moved towards left in the corridor. From there she could see what was Hans looking at. She stopped dead, someone was coming towards the house. That man came to Hans and they started talking. She couldn't hear anything. "Who is this man and why are they meeting at three in the morning", she thought. </p><p>That man took out something from his pocket and handed it to Hans and then went away. Hans also turned back. Shiv swiftly ran into her room and silently closed the door. After a few seconds she again heard footsteps passing. &nbsp;</p><p>"Are you sure it was him", asked James. "Hmm, pretty sure", replied Shiv. They were in the observatory. All huddled up together to listen Shiv's story. "Mark my words, he will turn out to be a ghost some day, that's why he roams in the house at nights ", remarked Agastya. Everyone stared at him. "What?" he said.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Be serious, you said he was searching something", said Aradhya. "Yes, so it seemed.",Shiv said, "And I'm wondering what that man gave him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">At that moment Hans entered, he didn't gave so much as a glance to them and went straight to his office, shutting the door behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"It could be that Hans meets this man often, I mean in the backyard, he doesn't go only to smoke.... maybe to meet this man", suggested Aradhya. " Yes it could be," said James, "but why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It was about four in the evening. Sky was clear and sunshine was entering in the observatory. Agastya and Aradhya were at the house for lunch. Hans in his office. Shiv was brooding over some papers of recent research and James was busy with the telescope. He was adjusting some equipments and was humming a tune. Classics were his favourite, he once told Shiv. This reminded her of Professor Sawhney. "I like old hindi songs", Professor had told, his face brightening at a sudden pleasure,"Old melodies....".</span></p><p>"Bzzz...Bzzzz", James' phone started vibrating. "Look who's it, Shiv", said James over his shoulder. "Hmm", Shiv said, "Hello".</p><p>"Jaaamess", said the voice.</p><p>"No, Shiv here", she corrected.</p><p>"SHIV, it's me Sawhney", said the voice.&nbsp;</p><p>"PROFESSOR, how are you.. where are....", stuttered Shiv. Until now James had come over to her.</p><p>"Lis..ten to me", Professor cut in,"I can't.. tell you where I am.. , but don't worry I'm safe. I want you to do something for me....."</p><p>"Yes Professor"</p><p>"Find that pen... you get it, THAT pen. Find it before they get it. I'll have to go.....they are following me........"</p><p>"Are you all right Professor?"</p><p>"I don't know, at least not untill you find it.....and yes don't try to contact me.... I'll contact you...."</p><p>"Pro..., it's disconnected", said Shiv. She felt a lump in her throat, her eyes wet.&nbsp;</p><p>James put a hand on her shoulder and said," Is he all right?"</p><p>"He said so. He said to find that pen", Shiv said. "Maybe because of that storage device in it", suggested James. "Hmm, he referred to some 'they' who were following him.... He is in danger."</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"What could be in that pen?", asked Agastya. "Something that could put Professor's life in danger", said Aradhya "something for which he can put his life in danger.......we'll have to find it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"But we have already searched his room and his office, where else we look", said Agastya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Those are the places where everyone will search, remember those officials, if Professor is sure that when they searched, they didn't got it then definitely he didn't hide it there. Let's search the house." suggested Aradhya. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p></div>
