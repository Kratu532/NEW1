            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Shiv woke up early this morning as they had to clear up the Professor's room for the new head. She, James and Mrs. Mufti were doing the job. Agastya simply refused to wake up so early," I do not want dark circles below my eyes". Aradhya is a very sound sleeper so either she deliberately didn't answered the banging of the door or she really was asleep is not clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Cleaning up the room was not so boring. James packed the clothes and Shiv cleared the possesions wheras Mrs. Mufti was ascorting the packed boxes to the basement.&nbsp;</p><p>"How's your book work going", asked Shiv. "Cool! Can you help me open this box?", said James. He was holding a very antique looking box. Shiv took it and tried to open the lid but failed. "OK, we'll not throw it. Try our luck next time," said Shiv and put the box on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon the work was done and it was still 6:15, so they both got ready for the breakfast earlier than the other two. "You know Professor once told me that his pen, whose case we found yesterday, had a storage piece in it where about 1 TB data can be stored", said Shiv. "Are you saying that, when yesterday the officers took the table decorations with them, they were trying to find that pen or that storage device," said James openmouthed. "And whatever Professor stored in it, is of immense value to them", said Shiv gravely.</p><p>Now Agastya and Aradhya were also down and they all ate together. "Well done guys! You've done all the cleaning", said Aradhya. "Thanks to my snores!", joked Agastya. "Ya, keep up the hard work", mocked James. </p><p>"What's in breakfast, grandma", asked Shiv to Mrs. Mufti. "Your favourite <em>parathas</em> my dear," said Mrs. Mufti smiling cordially.&nbsp;</p><p>"Fhen fish tha fead forming," Agastya tried to say. "Finish it first" scolded Aradhya "disgusting", she mumbled. Agastya gulped and repeated, "When is the head coming". "Anytime soon", replied James.</p><p>The sky was clear as it's the beginning of July (perfect for the telescope operation). The town in the valley was as beautiful and tranquil as ever. They started to work. Shiv was working on a report on the supernova which they had to send to ISRO for inspection. There was a knock on the door.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes grandma, what's the matter", enquired Shiv. "Someone's at house, want's to meet yeh all," she said. "I'll see," Shiv said.</p><p>Shiv followed Mrs. Mufti into the house. "Yes," she frowned at the man. He was a very sombre looking person, in his early forties. His face was pale and very expressionless. He wore a black suit as that of bussinessmen and had an air of gloom about him. "I am the replacement of Professor Sawhney, my name is Ashoka Hans", said he in a drawling voice. "He looks like <em>Severus Snape</em> in real life," Shiv thought.&nbsp;</p><p>"You will like to see your room first, I presume Professor Hans", said Shiv. "You are mistaken miss, I'll like to walk into the observatory first", he said dryly. He stood up, looked at Mrs. Mufti and said," Old lady will you place my things in my room". "Hmm", said Mrs. Mufti and mumbled something under her breath.</p><p>Mr. Hans entered the observatory and without looking at anyone else headed straight to Professor Sawhney's room (now his). "How rude", said Aradhya screwing her face.&nbsp;</p><p>After few minutes he came out and said," I want this door made up by tomorrow, and by the way what are you all working at". James explained everything to him. "Nice, and what about Sawhney's research, who's working on it". "No one at present", said Shiv. "Do you know why he was arrested," asked Aradhya. "I mind my own bussiness miss and hope you'll too", said he and started to inspect the observatory.&nbsp;</p><p>For some time they looked at him, and then continued their work. It was tiring as they had to work on the telescope too. Again they were late for lunch. "What would you like tea or supper," joked Mrs. Mufti. Shiv stayed at the observatory to work on the report. When she finished it, she stood up and started looking for Mr. Hans but didn't find him. She came out and started to head towards the backyard of their quarters. When she was at the back door, she heard a ruffling noise. She turned and saw Mr. Hans standing behind her. "What are you doing here?", he asked. "Looking for you Mr. Hans", she replied. "Why?", he groaned. "The report is ready, only if you look at it once," she said. "Put it in my room", he said and moved away.</p><p>Shiv felt something mysterious about this new person.</p><p>She went to Mr. Hans' room and put the report on the bed. His luggage was not yet opened. It was not much though, seeing that he was going to stay there for a long time. His possession included a bag for clothes and a breifcase (too less and who carries breifcase now-a-days). Shiv thought it was weird. But then there was everything weird about him.</p><p>After lunch or tea (not clear) Shiv came back to the observatory and resumed her work. After adjusting the telescope, they all freed up at 9:45 (to be exact). They all sat in the hall. Mr. Hans was in his room and Mrs. Mufti cooking up the dinner. James sat beside Shiv and said," This man is nuts. He is so gloomy and I've got to fix that door too". " By the way it's carpenter who's going to fix that door, you have just called him. And yes I too think he is strange", she said frowning at him. And she narrated the evening's event to him. By this time Agastya and Aradhya were also listening intently to her.</p><p>"I think he was trying to hunt rabbits in those bushes", joked Agastya. Aradhya frowned and shook her head. "Are you going to have dinner or not?", shouted Mrs. Mufti.&nbsp;</p><p>"Someone call Mr. Hans", said Mrs. Mufti when they all arranged themselves at the dining table. James went to call him.&nbsp;</p><p>They all ate together. Mr. Hans didn't utter a word during the dinner. He didn't even laugh at Agastya's jokes (which is usually a feat performed by Aradhya).&nbsp;</p><p>When finally Shiv entered her room she remembered about that box (which she found in Hans' room while clearing it up). She hurried to his room wondering whether Mr. Hans will be annoyed that she turned up to his room at such an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Hans opened the room looking as if someone threw slime at his face. "Yes", he said gloomily. "I forgot a thing of mine in this room can I have it?", asked Shiv. "Fast", said Hans. She entered the room. Obiously Hans was unpacking his clothes out. It consisted of two shirts, two trousers, a coat and some casuals (again too less for such a long stay). His briefcase was standing beside his bed. She grabbed that box and hurried out.</p><p>She was wondering about the weirdness of Hans when she fell asleep. &nbsp;</p></div>
