            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Shiv woke up with a start, what a bad dream it was Professor Sawhney arrested. But this fog cleared soon and the reality dawned on her. For few minutes she stayed in her bed motionless trying to grasp it all. How it all had changed in just a day. If it had not happened she would have been working with the Professor on her dream project. And then suddenly she remembered, as if someone has hit her head with it. That day, about a fortnight away, she was sitting in Professor's room when he asked her:</p><p><em>"Shiv, what if one day I leave this place suddenly, what you'll think of me". "What Professor, why," she half looked at his face and it was as solid as stone, she got scared for a second but answered,"Umm, if this happens then I'll know that you have something important at hand and that whatever you are doing has some meaning to you which we don't know but is of immense importance". "Will you believe that whatever I've done is for greater good, will you have faith in me?" asked Professor again. She hesitated for a moment then answered, "Yes, Professor I'll believe you". And then she noticed that his face smoothed as if he is infinitely relieved.&nbsp;</em></p><p>That day the conversation had no meaning to her but today it meant a lot. It means that he had already seen his arrest. At this thought she sprang from her bed and got ready (so fast that she tripped over about two times).</p><p>"Hey guys, I've something to tell you all," everyone sat around the table while Mrs. Mufti poured tea in everyone's cup, she was too very upset from the 'disappearence'. "I remembered something". And Shiv told them everything.</p><p>"He knew it already", said Aradhya. "And maybe he is the one who cleared all the stuff from his laptop before his arrest, so that no one can access it," suggested James. "What is this man hiding," said Agastya and stamped his fist on the table, and spilled his tea. "What are you doing dirty boy, now I'll have to teach you how to eat," said Mrs. Mufti and streached his ears. For the first time they all laughed and it felt so good.&nbsp;</p><p>After breakfast they went to the observatory. "Ah man, what we'll do of this door, James its your punishment to mend it," said Aradhya. "Why, it's because of me you all entered the room ............." and they started to argue. Shiv smiled and started to work. Their work was time consuming and tideous and hence even till noon they had not much progressed in their work of studying the supernova. All the data the telescope had collected through the night was also to be processed and hence they had no time to think about Professor or anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>It was past 2:30 when any of them thought of lunch or tea. They decided that Agastya will stay in the observatory and rest will go to lunch and bring for him too.</p><p>Mrs. Mufti was very accustomed to their lateness and hence she kept their lunch in fridge. She instantly prepared hot coffee and they all ate hungrily.</p><p>Suddenly their was a tap on the door. "I'll check", said Aradhya.&nbsp;</p><p>"Shiv, they are here to seize all the possesions of Professor Sawhney", she said in a barely audible voice. "Who", asked Shiv. She stood up and saw two police officers along with an official looking man.</p><p>"Can you show us the room of Mr. Sawhney", said the man in a heavy voice. "But why do you want his things", inquired James. "No questions sir, we are only following the orders", again said the man. James got angry but decided to remain silent. Shiv showed the way.</p><p>They ransacked the whole room but took nothing from there. The man came out from there and headed towards the observatory. They all followed him.</p><p>When he reached there with his two police officers he asked," Who did this?", indicating the slaughtered door. "We were trying to open the door but it was locked so we... Well no problem with that I suppose," said Shiv sternly. The man looked for a moment at her, jerked his shoulder and then&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">moved into the room. "Phew, thanks", said James smiling at her.</span></p><p>From here they took lots of papers, the laptop (which was useless but they didn't know), surprisingly all the small table decorations and his books. Then they came out and started to go. "Can you tell us what's happening, first Professor and now his possessions, what you guys are up to", asked Agastya. "We can't answer sir, we don't have the orders", said the man and turned away. One of the police officer looked at the group and said," These CBI's are a bit eccentric. When we were on the way I heard him say to someone on phone that this professor of your's has betrayed some....." he was cut short by the official who called him to come urgently. And they all went away.</p><p>"Professor betrayed someone", they all said in one tone. "No, I trust him, he can't", said Shiv. "I too trust him, he was the most honest person I've ever met, but then what was that officer saying," said James. No one has the answer.</p><p>That night, they do not have a lot of work so they arranged the telescope for the night (it was a computerised telescope so it didn't need manual adjusting), closed the observatory and came back to their 'home'.&nbsp;</p><p>Shiv and Aradhya were sitting on the sofa disscusing their theory about the supernova they had witnessed yesterday. Agastya was working on his laptop whereas James sat writing his book on <strong>"A guide to the stars"</strong>. About an hour later Mrs. Mufti called in for dinner.</p><p>"We'll have to clear Professor's room for the new head arriving tomorrow", said Aradhya. "Who's going to come?" asked Mrs. Mufti. "A replacement of the Professor grandma," said Shiv. "I'll need your help. I'm not doing it alone", ordered Mrs. Mufti. Shiv smiled cordially. She was thinking about the officials. Why did they took the table decorations? Well she had the pen case of the Professor. What happened to the Professor? Who's going to come tomorrow? Lots of questions and no answers.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span></p></div>
