            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Knock,knock", someone was on the door. But it was too early, who could it be. Shiv thought as she reluctantly woke up. She threw her sheets away and opened the door. "Oh, Professor Sawhney. Good morning sir, how come", she asked. "Shiv we saw it blaze dazzlingly before our eyes", Professor Sawhney exclaimed. "What! I missed it, how unlucky", Shiv regretted. "Get ready and come to the observatory fast", ordered Professor Sawhney.</span><br></p><p>Shiv was rushing towards the observatory as fast as she could. "How stupid it was to go to sleep when she knew it was so certain the star will explode that night", she thought.</p><p>She pushed the door open and rushed to the computer analyst and her colleague Agastya. Punched the buttons of the computer and saw the image of a dazzling supernova. To all of us it was &nbsp;mere a big white spot on the grey background but to her it was the time of her life.</p><p>As she was marvelling over the beauty of the image, she heard the sound of the blades of a chopper whizzing past the air. It was not unusual for helicoptors to land in the Shambala Astronomical Observatory. But it was rare at this early in the morning. It's still dawn. She did not bother to look out at the sour faces of the officials, instead she was happy with her "white blot".</p><p>"How could you do that, NO,please", cried Aradhya. Shiv heard this and came out of the observation hall. What! They are arresting Professor Sawhney, why?</p><p>The police officials and the CBI officers were handcuffing the professor. Shiv instantly reached them and asked the officials about the matter. Reluctantly they said that he had commited a serious offence but what exactly 'the offence' &nbsp;was they refused to tell.</p><p>As they all were about to mount the chopper suddenly professor Sawhney stopped and turned. There was something in his eyes, as if he dreaded something very serious. Untill this time everyone was out in the garden. He turned, he was looking straight into Shiv's eyes and said,</p><p>"WE CAN'T HOLD IT LONGER. THE TIME HAS COME THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH."</p><p>The officials hurled him inside and flew away.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone was dead silent. No one has ever dreamed about anything like this on such an important day.</p><p>Aradhya neared Shiv, she was very afraid. She asked,"Shiv, what was it?"</p><p>Shiv said,"I think I know!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
